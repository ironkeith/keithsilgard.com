			<h1 class="intense">I make stuff.</h1>

			<p>Websites mostly, but it doesn't really matter. I just love to have a problem, and find a solution. I'm all about the search; putting together all of the pieces and trying to find a solution that's just right.</p>
			
			<p>I like the little details. The small things that separate good enough from amazing. In a perfect world, I could nit-pick and critique all day long, and that would somehow be productive.</p>
			
			<p>I want to create something that will last longer than me.</p>
