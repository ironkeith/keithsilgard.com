			<h1>I make stuff.</h1>

			<p>Websites, mostly. I work at <a href="http://www.whitespark.ca">Whitespark</a>, happily programming away. If you want to get ahold of me, I’d suggest <a href="mailto:hey@keithsilgard.com">email</a>, though I guess <a href="http://twitter.com/ironkeith">Twitter</a> may work as well. I do HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, even a little Ruby and Obj-C.</p>
		
			<p>Take a peek at some of the stuff I’ve been working on below.</p>

			<p>I’m super proud of this one. It’s the first site I ever built where I was able to put the effort in to build it as well as I could.</p>
		
			<h4>Stuff I did for this one:</h4>
		
			<ul>
				<li>All of the HTML/CSS/JS</li>
				<li>Most of the page layouts (though not the actual design)</li>
				<li>The landing page for the <a href="http://www.whitespark.ca/local-citation-finder/">Local Citation Finder</a></li>
				<li>A great application theme (for the LCF, and the CMS)</li>
				<li>Heaps of the copywriting</li>
				<li>Photography</li>
				<li>Easter eggs!</li>
			</ul>
