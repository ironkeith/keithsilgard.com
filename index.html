	<h2>I&rsquo;m Keith. I make websites.</h2>
	
	<p>I made my first (really awful) site on Angelfire in the dark days of the internet. Since then, I've gone to <a href="http://www.dimd.nait.ca/">school</a>, and now I work for a fun company called <a href="http://www.whitespark.ca">Whitespark</a> in Edmonton.</p>
	
	<p>I do programmery stuff, mostly in PHP (though I do love me some Ruby, and I have a crazy itch to get into Objective-C). I also love me some HTML &amp; CSS, and think of myself as somewhat of a entrepreneur.</p>
	
	<p>If you're interested in getting in touch with me, your best bet is <a href="mailto:ksilgard@gmail.com">email</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/ironkeith">Twitter</a>. I might friend you on <a href="http://facebook.com/keith.silgard">Facebook</a>, but only if I <strong>actually</strong> know you.</p>
