			<h1>I make stuff.</h1>

			<p>Websites, mostly. I work at <a href="http://www.whitespark.ca">Whitespark</a>, happily programming away. If you want to get ahold of me, I’d suggest <a href="mailto:hey@keithsilgard.com">email</a>, though I guess <a href="http://twitter.com/ironkeith">Twitter</a> may work as well. I do HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, even a little Ruby and Obj-C.</p>
