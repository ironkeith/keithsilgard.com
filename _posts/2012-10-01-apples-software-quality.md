title: Apple’s Software Quality
description: As Apple's products become increasingly software driven, and software complexity increases, quality and user experience are taking a dive.

I'm an Apple fan, and I've bought into the Apple ecosystem in a pretty big way. Every day I use: my MacBook Pro with a Cinema Display, my iPhone 4S, a first gen iPad, and an Apple TV. I've bought enough iPods over the years to amass [this collection](http://twitter.com/i/#!/ironkeith/media/slideshow?url=pic.twitter.com%2FQ34Vpeph) in a drawer. I'm also a geek. I know how computers work. I write software for a living.

There's been a lot of press since the launch of iOS 6 about the inconsistent map data for Apple Maps, but otherwise reviews have been fairly glowing. Mountain Lion was released earlier this summer, also to a positive reception. When people review Apple products, they often mention the value of the Apple ecosystem and how everything "just works". I think that's fast becoming Apple's biggest misconception.

I've become incredible frustrated with the quality of Apple's software. Two weeks ago, I started keeping a list of every bug I encountered during normal daily usage:

- Safari's UI occasionally gets all messed up when it's in the background
- Safari's address bar would only display the domain name, not the full address (restarting fixed it)
- I cannot get iPhoto to send a picture via email
- iPhoto error: "The iPhoto Library is locked, on a locked disk, or you do not have permission to make changes to it."
- iPhoto repeatedly unmounts my camera when I attempt an import, and I don't have an SD slot
- With around 40,000 photos, iPhoto is unusably slow
- Top left corner of my iPhone wouldn't respond to clicks (restarting fixed it)
- Three finger swiping stopped working for exposé, the started again after about an hour (confirmed it was still enabled in System Preferences)
- This note won't show up on my iPhone, so I've missed a few iPhone bugs because I forget about them before I get back to my laptop. Yay iCloud!
- Quick Look refuses to respond when trying to preview several large images. It just pretends I didn't hit spacebar
- Apple TV wouldn't play videos I purchased from iTunes. There was no feedback, it just pretended I didn't press play (a software update fixed it)
- Remote app for iOS consistently cannot connect to my either of my Apple TV's (I have to double-click the home button and manually quit it before it will connect again)
- Bookmark sync is messed up on my phone, and refuses to acknowledge all of the bookmarks in my bookmarks bar (the bookmarks folder is there, but it only shows three of my six bookmarks)
- iPhoto for iOS crashes every time it tries to display a list of photos
- My MacBook got crazy hot, and wouldn't wake from sleep
- Bluetooth stopped working on my MacBook ([https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4140781?start=0&tstart=0](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4140781?start=0&tstart=0))
- Photos that are not in my Photostream show up in my Apple TV's "Photostream" slideshow
- Safari developer console can't be cleared

Now some of these are cosmetic annoyances, but several are complete blockers. If I had an iMac instead of a MacBook, losing Bluetooth would mean losing the ability to use a keyboard or mouse. Not many people know to double-click the home button to manually quit an app on iOS, so if they've also lost the super small Apple remotes, they wouldn't be able to use their Apple TV without buying another one. Non-geeks wouldn't be trying to fix these problems, they'd be frustrated because their devices are broken. \[[1](#footnotes)\]

The worst of these are the ones that are consistent, and unmissable. Anyone using the Remote app with an Apple TV knows about the connection problems. Anyone using iPhoto recognizes how terribly it performs. I doubt that everyone at Apple is using Chrome when they develop their own sites. People at Apple have to be encountering these problems, but they're still shipping them. That's not indicative of a culture of excellence. Jony Ive is measuring the fit of glass panels to the micron, and the result is a perfect phone that sometimes doesn't work.

I used to be an evangelist for Apple products. My Mom has a MacBook Air and an iPhone because I told her it would be so much simpler for her. My Dad and brother both use iPads. My wife has an iPhone. For years I was practically an Apple salesperson, recommending Apple products to anyone who asked. Now I'm an apologist. When search on iOS email doesn't work, it's me explaining that search only works for the emails on your phone (for no good reason). When my wife's iPhone locks, and the screen won't respond to touches, it's me explaining that she has to wait a minute, and if that doesn't help she needs to do a hard reset. When my Mom complains about some silly message that shows up with a bunch of techno babble every morning, it's me that has to buy her more iCloud storage because she hasn't been backing up for a few weeks. When sharing photos on Facebook won't work for my friend Caroline, it's me helping her debug it.

So now I don't recommend Apple products. I don't recommend against them, but I certainly don't evangelize them. I didn't even get into things that are merely frustrating instead of broken. As Apple introduces complexity, quality is taking a dive. I get that the work they're doing is difficult, but Apple needs to understand that to most people these aren't bugs. They're broken devices, and when people depend on these devices, they're broken trust. Trust is fickle, and Apple is losing mine.
