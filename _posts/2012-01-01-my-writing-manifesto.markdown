# My Writing Manifesto 

**I want to create something that can last, and something that I can be proud of.**

I've written hundred of posts over the years. I've also removed almost all of them. Especially any that break the following rules:

##### No Link Posts

If I want to share a link, I'll post it to Twitter.

##### No Angry Rants

No one cares about my whining.

##### No Bad Stand-Up

Observational humour about my life isn't interesting to anyone who isn't me.

##### Be Constructive

Cynicism is equally easy and worthless. It's great to have an opinion, but don't be a dick about it.

##### Don't Be Lazy

Do the research. Write confidently.

##### Don't Be Afraid of Being Wrong

Nothing here is written in stone. Feel free to edit.

##### Make it Mean Something

Don't write for the sake of writing.
