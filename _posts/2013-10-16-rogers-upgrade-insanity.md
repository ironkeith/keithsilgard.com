title: Rogers Upgrade Insanity
description: I want a new phone. Rogers wants me to switch carriers.
category: articles
---
Two years ago, I bought an iPhone 4S, and signed a three year contract with Rogers. Yesterday, I called Rogers because I wanted to upgrade. When I priced everything out, I was shocked to discover that it would actually be cheaper to change carriers to Telus, penalties and all.

**I save $50.01 by taking my business elsewhere**, and my wife gets a new iPhone (even though she doesn't really want or need one).

I played out some alternate scenarios, and was equally surprised by the results.

<table class="table table-condensed">
	<caption>Cost of purchasing phones unsubsidized instead of upgrading with Rogers</caption>
	<thead>
	  <tr>
	  	<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th scope="col">One person</th>
		<th scope="col">Two people</th>
	  </tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Hardware</th>
		<td>$819.00</td>
		<td>$1,638.00</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Connection fee</th>
		<td>$15.00</td>
		<td>$30.00</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly wireless + data (next 12 months)</th>
		<td>$85.00&nbsp;(1GB&nbsp;data)</td>
		<td>$160.00&nbsp;(3GB&nbsp;shared&nbsp;data)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly wireless + data (unsubsidized price)</th>
		<td>$65.00&nbsp;(1GB&nbsp;data)</td>
		<td>$120.00&nbsp;(3GB&nbsp;shared&nbsp;data)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Total over two years</th>
		<th>$2,634.00</th>
		<th>$5,028.00</th>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

The costs of purchasing the phone unlocked are almost identical, but it gives me an interesting option: switching to Telus without penalty after 12 months.

<table class="table table-condensed">
	<caption>Cost of purchasing phones unsubsidized and switching to Telus after 12 months</caption>
	<thead>
	  <tr>
	  	<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th scope="col">One person</th>
		<th scope="col">Two people</th>
	  </tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Hardware</th>
		<td>$819.00</td>
		<td>$1,638.00</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly wireless + data (next 12 months)</th>
		<td>$85.00&nbsp;(1GB&nbsp;data)</td>
		<td>$160.00&nbsp;(3GB&nbsp;shared&nbsp;data)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly wireless (after switching to Telus)</th>
		<td>$35.00</td>
		<td>$70.00</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly data (after switching to Telus)</th>
		<td>$30.00&nbsp;(1GB)</td>
		<td>$45.00&nbsp;(2GB shared)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Total over two years</th>
		<th>$2,619.00</th>
		<th>$4,938.00</th>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

If I just pay cash for the phones, then switch to Telus after 12 months, **I save $71.99**, and I'm off contract for the second year.

To further complicate things, my wife doesn't really want to upgrade right now, so how do things look for Rogers if we hold off on her upgrade for 12 months?

<table class="table table-condensed">
	<caption>Waiting 12 months to upgrade my wife</caption>
	<thead>
	  <tr>
	  	<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<th scope="col">My costs</th>
		<th scope="col">My&nbsp;wife's&nbsp;costs</th>
	  </tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Hardware</th>
		<td>$819</td>
		<td>$329.99/$319&nbsp;[<a href="#footnotes">1</a>]</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Connection fee</th>
		<td>$15.00</td>
		<td>$15.00 (Rogers only)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly wireless + data<br>(first 12 months)</th>
		<td>$105.00&nbsp;(3GB&nbsp;shared&nbsp;data)</td>
		<td>$55.00</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly wireless + data<br>(2nd 12 months with Rogers)</th>
		<td>$85.00&nbsp;(3GB&nbsp;shared&nbsp;data)</td>
		<td>$55.00</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly wireless<br>(2nd 12 months with Telus)</th>
		<td>$35.00</td>
		<td>$55.00</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row">Monthly data<br>(2nd 12 months with Telus)</th>
		<td colspan="2">$45.00&nbsp;(2GB shared)</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row" colspan="2">Total over two years (with Rogers)</th>
		<th>$4,778.99</th>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<th scope="row" colspan="2">Total over two years (with Telus)</th>
		<th>$4,678.00</th>
	  </tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

So there you have it, **in the cheapest possible upgrade scenario, I save $100.99, am contract free after one year, and I accomplish this by leaving Rogers**. They are directly incentivizing me to take my business elsewhere. Insanity.
