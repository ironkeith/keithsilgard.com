Let's just face facts: I'm probably not the best employee. Opinions? I got 'em. Stubbornness? In spades. I've managed so far by finding companies willing to accept my eccentricities, and I've been lucky in that regard. But there's always been an itch, and now is the time to scratch it.


I've been at this web development game for around a decade now. It's a good fit for me. My restlessness and impatience are abated by the rapid pace of change. My curiousity is sated by the abundance of new avenues to explore. My independence? Until now, it's always been stifled.

With each new job I've taken, I've always pushed for more freedom, and more control. At my first job I had none of either. At my last, I had quite a bit of both. It still wasn't enough. I've never been any good at not getting my way. There are squandered opportunities in my past. Projects where I felt like I could have made something work, where I could have made a difference. I've always felt powerless, fighting from the sidelines, watching it fail. In the end I'm left wondering, "could it have worked if we did it my way?"

I left my job at Statusfirm intent on finding out the answer, but I was a coward. It was just so easy to have a job, and a paycheque. And honestly, for the last three years at Whitespark, if I leaned back and squinted just enough, I thought that maybe—just maybe—this could be what I wanted.

It was an easy lie to tell myself. I had friends, and challenges. I had the freedom to do things as I saw fit. I had the opportunity to work on projects that thousands of people used every day. It was everything I wanted, but it was hollow. Because it wasn't mine. Because I wasn't actually driving it. Because it wasn't my dream coming true.

The thing is, I've never been chasing money, or power, or adulation (maybe adulation...). It's control that I want. And I'm just so blindly, maddeningly afraid of it. Terrified to learn that the answer is "your ideas are bad, and your work is bad, and you are bad, and you will fail." My chest tightens, and my mind races, and my brain yells "**STOP! This is madness. This is stupid. You have a family. You're being selfish.**"

I'm afraid of failing. I miss my friends. I feel so alone, and so uncertain. \[[1](#footnotes)\]

I'm amazingly excited. I'm finally in control. I have so many ideas.

I'm proud to announce [Fynt](http://www.fynt.ca). My own company, and my own destiny. Thank you to everyone who helped me get here.

Here's to facing uncertainty, consequences be damned.
