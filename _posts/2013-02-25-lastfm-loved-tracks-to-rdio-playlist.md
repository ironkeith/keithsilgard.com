Hey, this is super easy and safe \[[1](#footnotes)\]! I'm going to make you a super great Rdio playlist using all of the songs you've loved on Last.fm \[[2](#footnotes)\], and I'm going to do it pretty automagically. Stick with me kid, I'll have you farting through silk.

<form action="/lastfm-favs-to-rdio/rdio-auth.php" method="get" accept-charset="utf-8" class="form-horizontal">
	<div style="text-align: center">
		<button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Step 1: Connect to Rdio</button>
	</div>
</form>

<!-- END -->

1. I won't do anything creepy or annoying with your Rdio or Last.fm accounts. I'll just create a playlist, then forget all about you.
2. Well... the most recent 250 of them.
