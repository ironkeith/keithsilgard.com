The average Android phone released in 2012 had a 4.2" screen. The Galaxy Note II was the size champ at an amazing 5.5", and people are actually buying those monstrosities. In comparison, the iPhone 5 has a paltry 4" screen. So the question is, if people want giant phones, should Apple release one?

There are a lot of reasons why I don't think I'd like it. I recently spent a few weeks with a 4.65" Galaxy Nexus, and even though I have big mitts, I couldn't reach the full screen with one hand. I found that I'd have to either hold it with both hands, like a tiny tablet, or hold it with one hand, and tap with the other. It was annoying.

I suppose it could be interesting if the extra space were being used effectively, but [pundits are predicting](http://www.marco.org/2013/01/31/iphone-plus-speculation) that apps will just be scaled up. I suppose developers *could* put more on the screen, but in practice I doubt they will. \[[2](#footnotes)\]

A bigger iPhone just doesn't seem very Apple-like to me. Larger screens eat up battery life, and are awkward to hold. You'd think that the larger touch targets would make it easier to navigate, but the awkward hand contortions necessary to reach the top of the screen actually make it more difficult. An especially glaring problem is iOS's convention for placing the "back" button in the top left corner. Right handed users are going to have a hell of a time stretching for those. Apple isn't known for bowing to pressure to make products that compromise user experience — take netbooks for example — so it would be strange to see Apple release a worse phone because it looks better lined up on a shelf.

The worst of it is that I really can't see any advantage beyond "people think they want big screens". To completely offset the difference, all you need to do is hold the smaller screen slightly closer to your face.

And it's not even all that much closer either. Around 4" does the trick. Unless there's some key benefit I'm missing, the release of a bigger iPhone would be Apple placating pundits and customers who blindly believe that bigger is better, and sacrificing the user experience to do it.

1.	These would be even higher if I took the time to filter out phones with QWERTY keyboards. [Brent](https://twitter.com/brentley_11/) pointed out that it would be interesting to try and figure out the average screen size per phone sold (to filter out all the weirdos and failures)
2.	Look at how few developers have done any tweaking of their iPad apps after the release of the iPad mini
