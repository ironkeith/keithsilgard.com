title: An Easy Way to Use Safe Passwords
description: If you use the same password everywhere, that's dumb. This is an easy way to fix that.

Do you have one password that you use for everything? Is that password shorter than 12 characters long? If so, that's super dumb. Don't feel bad though, pretty well everyone does that same dumb thing. I don't blame you either. Remembering unique, 12+ character passwords — in addition to usernames — for every site you use is basically impossible.

## Why every site needs a different password

When you sign up for any site online \[[1](#footnotes)\], they need to save your password in a database. Unfortunately, safely storing these passwords is really hard, and a lot of sites do it wrong. Some sites store your password with no security precautions at all. That makes [stealing passwords](https://www.google.com/search?q=passwords%20stolen) a super common tactic for dickhead thieves. If you use the same password for every site, you're only as safe as the least secure site you're using.

## Common password tactics that do nothing

Does your password end in a "1", or some other number? Did you swap a vowel for a number? Congrats, you've effectively made it take a few minutes instead of a few seconds to crack your password. You've probably saved yourself from some clown guessing it by typing a few common patterns, but that's about it. 

Common tactics that lead to a false sense of security involve:

* adding a number at the end of a dictionary word or name: `pasta1`
* replacing vowels with numbers: `p4ssw0rd`
* keyboard sequences: `asdfghjkl`, `qwertyuiop`, etc.
* using your phone number, birthday, or any other personally identifiable sequences: `1994/06/24`, `7805556792`, etc.

None of those things are bad, it's just that none of them will help you if you have a short password.

## A super easy way to make a pretty good password

1. Come up with an uncommon, three or four word phrase: `hot garbage soup`, `great underwear divide`, `ugly green drapes` (just make sure it ends up being at least 12 characters long)
2. Remove spaces, add at least one number, and at least one capital (this isn't for extra security, it's so that your password will work on stupid sites that have password restrictions): `hotG4rb4geSoup`, `gr34tUnderw34rDivide`, `uglyGr33nDrapes`

Huge success. You've created an easy to remember, easy to type password that's exponentially safer than what you're using right now \[[2](#footnotes)\]. Go change your bank and email password right now.

## Now do that three times

Those passwords are hard to crack. If a bad guy gets a database with your password in it (and it's properly stored), it would be really annoying to figure it out. That said, it's not impossible (and it's not always going to be properly stored), so that's why you need to create and remember three different passwords.

1. **Super Important Password**  
	This is your bank, and your email address. Anything where your life could be ruined if bad guys gain access. (Remember, your email can likely be used to access every other site you use.)

2. **Pretty Important Password**  
	This is Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, TicketMaster, and anything that stores your credit card number. If someone gets this password it would be bad, but you could probably recover. You want to keep this group pretty small if you can.

3. **Everything Else Password**  
	This is pretty straight forward. If some jerk site stores your password in plain text, and some asshat steals their database and gets your password, hopefully it can't be used to ruin your life.

This is a totally manageable system that is probably a whole heck of a lot safer than whatever you're doing right now. You're still sharing passwords, but at least you've managed to contain the possible damage \[[3](#footnotes)\].

## Bonus: a kind of annoying way to use super safe, unique passwords for every site

There are applications that can do this for you. I strongly recommend [1password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword). It will create, and remember insanely long, ultra secure passwords for every site you visit. There are also iOS and Android apps, so you can sync your passwords to your phone/tablet. This is the only way you can truly limit the potential damage of a compromised password. (Though it also creates a single point of failure, because if someone has access to your 1passwork app, the have full access to your life. *eep*)

<hr id="footnotes">

1. You might have noticed that lots of sites let you sign up using your Google, Twitter, or Facebook accounts. On the plus side, that's one less password to remember, but that peace of mind comes at a (sometimes significant) loss of privacy.
2. Don't literally use those passwords. Make your own, you lazy bugger.
3. For bonus security points, you can add part of the current domain name and make every site's password unique. So, if you're on facebook.com, you could take the 3-5th letters (fa**ceb**ook), and make your password `cebHotG4rb4geSoup`.
