#Oh, hey there...

You're snooping the repo for my site... I wouldn't have any idea why. I guess I can tell you a bit about the site.

* It's built [using Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which I like
* I used Less for the CSS, and stole a bunch of stuff from Bootstrap
* There is absolutely nothing in the site that will allow a 3rd party to be a creep show and track you
* If this site doesn't work in IE/Firefox/Opera/etc, it's because I never bothered to check ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
