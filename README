Oh Hey There
============
You're snooping the repo for my site... I wouldn't have any idea why. I guess I can tell you a bit about the site.

* It's built using fun stuff! 
	* SASS for the CSS
	* Jekyll for generating files statically
	* Pygments for syntax highlighting
* I want to start writing more, so I'm going for a super readable site
* I really want to make it nice and responsive, stealing some ideas from [Ethan Marcotte](http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/) and [Andy Clarke](http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/)
* I also stole a bunch of stuff from the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* I do all of my coding, writing, and loving via [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)
* All of everything I do is on a Macbook
* If this site doesn't work in IE/Firefox/Opera/etc, it's because I never bothered to check
* Designed by me in Alberta ;-)
