title: About Me
description: Everything that you've always wanted to know about me, and at least three things you didn't.
---
I make websites. I do programmery stuff. I basically hate the internet. I'm all about keeping things as simple as they can be.

I'm tall (and no, I do not play basketball anymore).

I love reading, writing, music, and booze. I hate people who make lists about stuff they love.

I have a personal life, filled with wonderful things which if you know me, you already know all about, and if you don't, you don't need to.
