<h1 class="intense">All About Me</h1>

I'm tall (and no, I do not play basketball anymore). 

I've been making professional websites since 2004 (though I was making terribly unprofessional ones long before that). I do programmery stuff, mostly in PHP (though there's also Ruby, and Objective-C). I love HTML & CSS, and tinkering with design. I'm all about keeping things as simple as they can be.

I work for [Whitespark](http://www.whitespark.ca) in Edmonton, doing a bit of everything.

I love reading, writing, music, and wine. I hate scented candles, mint chocolate, and lazy grammar.

I have a personal life, filled with wonderful things which if you know me, you already know all about, and if you don't, you don't need to.
